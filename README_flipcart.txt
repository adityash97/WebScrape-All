I have used Chrome as my browser and Python3.

Step 1:

Install required packages for python3.
Command : 
 pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3:

Commands : 
 cd TrustChecker(changing current dir)
 python3 flipcart.py



NOTE :
1. Chrome must be updated one
2. Which page is currently being scraped will be displayed in python console.
3. To Change how many number of page to be scraped change "no_of_page_to_be_scraped" variable in 
   flipcart.py file.By default it is 13(13*24(no of product per page) = 312 products)
4. I have attached a scraped trustchecker.csv file for reference.
